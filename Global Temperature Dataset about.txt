GISS Surface Temperature Analysis
The Elusive Absolute Surface Air Temperature (SAT)
(Updated Mar. 18, 2022)

The GISTEMP analysis is based on calculating temperature anomalies, not absolute temperature. Temperature 
anomalies are computed relative to our base period 1951-1980. The reason we work with anomalies, rather than 
absolute temperature, is that absolute temperature varies enormously over short distances, while monthly or 
annual temperature anomalies are representative of a much larger region. Indeed, we have shown (Hansen and 
Lebedeff, 1987) that temperature anomalies are strongly correlated out to distances of the order of 1000 km. 
This makes it significantly more accurate to estimate anomalies between stations and in data-sparse areas.
